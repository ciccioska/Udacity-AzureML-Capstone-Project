# Udacity Machine Learning Engineer - Capstone project

This project is the capstone project related to the Azure ML Engineer path, this is the final project.
The topic of the project will be to train a model with AutoML, train a model with HyperParameter and finally deploy the best model between the mentioned above.

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.
The dataset represent the number of tsunami occured in the world from the 2100 BC, a tsunami it's a terrible natural event caused by earthquake in the deep of the ocaen. These events are very catastrophic, because a tsunami is anomalous wave height from 10 meters from the sea to the coast. 

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.
The task I want to accomplish is to predict how many deatch can cause a tsunami event, based on the column DEATHS_TOTAL_DESCRIPTION.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.
The dataset is free and it can be downloade from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/tsunami-dataset?select=tsunami_dataset.csv), but I downloaded it and useed it in Azure ML.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
